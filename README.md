## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

Amid a shift from static ‚Äúnearby + rating‚Äù lists to context-aware personalization, Whats'Eat presents an explainable, multi-agent restaurant recommendation system. Built on a Supervisor‚ÄìAgents graph using *LangGraph*, the system concurrently orchestrates an Places Agent and a User Profile Agent (both idempotent) to gather geographic evidence and lightweight behavioral signals. A KG-based RAG Recommender Agent then fuses a *Neo4j* knowledge graph with *Pinecone* vector retrieval for candidate recall and multi-factor ranking, and a Summarizer Agent produces a UI-ready {cards, rationale} JSON payload. Engineering contributions include contract-first JSON flows, idempotent tool calls with retries, field-masked API usage, pagination-stable ingestion, and a React frontend for map/route and card rendering. Functional tests cover places, profile, RAG, and summarization paths; in real use cases the system improves preference fit and explanation clarity over non-retrieval conversational baselines. This work contributes: 

- **A parallel-yet-controlled multi-agent orchestration pattern**
- **An evidence that hybrid KG + vector retrieval is effective for local-services recommendations**
- **A strict output contract with reproducible implementation details, providing a foundation for broader local-service scenarios.**

### 5.3 Interacting with the Recommendation System

#### Step 3: Describe Your Preferences
- In the **chat input field**, describe what you're looking for:
  - *"I want Asian fusion food near the office"*
  - *"Looking for a quiet caf√© with good WiFi"*
  - *"Fine dining experience for a special occasion"*
  - *"Halal restaurants with good reviews"*
  - *"Budget-friendly hawker centers"*

- You can mention:
  - **Cuisine types**: Chinese, Italian, Japanese, Thai, etc.
  - **Dietary preferences**: Vegetarian, vegan, halal, kosher
  - **Atmosphere**: Casual, fine dining, family-friendly, romantic
  - **Budget**: Cheap, moderate, expensive
  - **Special requirements**: WiFi, outdoor seating, parking, delivery
  - **Ratings/Reviews**: Quality expectations

#### Step 4: System Processing
The multi-agent system orchestrates four concurrent agents:

1. **Places Agent**: Searches nearby restaurants using Google Maps API
2. **User Profile Agent**: Builds a profile from your preferences and chat history
3. **RAG Recommender Agent**: 
   - Queries Neo4j knowledge graph for restaurant attributes
   - Performs Pinecone vector similarity search for semantic matching
   - Ranks candidates using multi-factor scoring
4. **Summarizer Agent**: Generates AI-powered explanations for each recommendation

#### Step 5: Review Restaurant Recommendations
The system returns personalized recommendations as **interactive cards** displaying:
- **Restaurant Name & Cuisine**: Quick identification
- **Rating & Review Count**: Social proof
- **Distance & Travel Time**: From your location
- **Why It Matches**: AI-generated explanation tailored to your request
- **Address & Contact**: Location details
- **Action Buttons**:
  - üîó **View Details**: Opens full restaurant profile
  - ‚≠ê **Directions**: Launches navigation
  - üó∫Ô∏è **Map**: Showing the street view and distance

### 5.6 Tips for Better Recommendations

1. **Be Specific**: Rather than "I want to eat", try "I'm craving spicy Thai food in a group-friendly environment"
2. **Mention Context**: Include occasion details - "Quick lunch during work break" vs "Romantic dinner date"
3. **Use Follow-ups**: Start broad, then refine: Ask general questions first, then request specific cuisines or amenities
4. **Check Ratings**: Pay attention to review counts and ratings displayed on cards
5. **Review the Explanation**: Read the AI-generated rationale to understand why a restaurant was recommended
6. **Trust the Map**: Verify distances and routes on the interactive map before committing

---

### 5.7 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Location not detected** | Enable location permissions in browser settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security |
| **No results appearing** | Try broadening your criteria or checking internet connection |
| **Map not loading** | Verify Google Maps API key is correctly configured in `.env` |
| **Slow recommendations** | Clear browser cache or wait for backend services (Neo4j, Pinecone) to stabilize |
| **Chat not responding** | Check backend server is running on `localhost:8000` and OpenAI API key is valid |
| **Restaurant details missing** | Indicates data gap in knowledge graph; try different search criteria |

### 5.8 System Architecture Overview (For Reference)

The WhatsEat system uses a **LangGraph Supervisor** pattern:

```
User Input
    ‚Üì
Supervisor Agent
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Places Agent (parallel) ‚Üí Google Maps API
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí User Profile Agent (parallel) ‚Üí Preference Analysis
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí RAG Recommender Agent ‚Üí Neo4j + Pinecone
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Summarizer Agent ‚Üí AI Explanation
    ‚Üì
Frontend Rendering (React + TypeScript)
```

This design ensures:
- ‚úÖ Parallel evidence gathering for faster responses
- ‚úÖ Explainable recommendations with rationale
- ‚úÖ Knowledge graph + vector search fusion for accuracy
- ‚úÖ Idempotent operations with automatic retries
